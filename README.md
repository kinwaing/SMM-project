# SMM-project

In this project we make use of a Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network implementation that was cloned into this repo, and can also be found here: https://github.com/liyaguang/DCRNN

Jupyter Notebooks containing the code for data analysis, graph constructions, and file generation needed for DCRNN can be found in Data-Analysis folder.
